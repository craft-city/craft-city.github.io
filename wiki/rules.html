							<li>Do not impersonate (i.e. putting someones username in your nickname)</li>

						</ul>
					<li class="main">PvP Arena Rules</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Do not logout while in the active PvP area. (Note: The server logs report whether logouts are network errors or actual logouts, so don't try to claim a PvP log was a network error when it really wasn't)</li>
							<li>Please remember to be respectful.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>
				<p id="intro-text">Staff members can and will take action against players who do not abide by these rules. Rules are subject to change at any time.</p>
