		<h3><u>Rules</u></h3>
		<h4>Make sure to review the rules <a href="/wiki/rules.html" target=blank_>here</a>.</h4>
		<h4>Clarifications:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Greifing is allowed if it is outside of a sponge protection. Players are responsible for the own builds. If you recieve a greifing complaint and it is not inside a protected area, politely explain to them that they must claim their area for it to be protected.</li>
			<li>The word "hell" does not fall under the profanity ban unless it is abused (i.e. "go to hell")</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3><u>Offenses</u></h3>
		<b>Profanity:</b> 15 minute mute for minor offense, 30 for major.
		<br>
		<b>Exploits/Glitches:</b> DO NOT BAN, notify me, and I will look into the situation. It is hard to prove these kinds of claims.
		<br>
		<b>Advertising:</b> If it is a major advertisement, (i.e. logging on and spamming the IP of another server), ban the player immediately. If it is simply a regular player putting the IP of another server in the chat, politely ask them to stop.
		<br>
		<b>Impersonation:</b> Use /realname [nick] to determine the real username of the player. If they are impersonating somebody else, mute them for 5 minutes, and politely ask them to change back their nickname.
		<br>
		<b>Spamming:</b> If the player is using caps lock too much, ask them to stop. If it continues, mute them for 15 minutes. If they are advertising, refer to the advertisement line above.
		<br>
		<b>Mods:</b> If you feel that a person is using a mod that gives them advantage over other players, notify me. I will sort out the issue.
		<br>
		<b>Religion/Politics:</b> If a player is discussing religion/politics, politely ask them to stop.
		<br>
		<b>Racism/Sexism:</b> If a minor offense, mute for 30 minutes. If major, ban immediately.
		<br>
		<b>PvP Logging:</b> Jail for 15 minutes.
		
		<h3><u>Commands</u></h3>
		Mute: <i><b>/mute [player] [time]m</b></i>, then message the player with the reason (<i><b>/m [player] [reason]</b></i>). Ex: /mute TrainGaming 5m (DON'T FORGET THE m, as it specifies minutes)
		<br>
		Jail: <i><b>/jail [player] main [time]</i></b>. Ex: /jail TrainGaming main 5m (DON'T FORGET THE m, as it specifies minutes)
		<br>
		Ban: <i><b>/ban [player] [reason]</i></b>
		<br>
		<font color="red">Don't forget to include a time, and always provide a reason.</font>
